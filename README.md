# population-treemap

U.S. population treemap from 2020 census data

## Getting Started

You'll need an API key for accessing the 2020 Census data. Head to [api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html) to request a key.

Create a `config.py` file and add your key as a variable as so

```python
API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
```

## Terrific!! Now you're as far as I am!
